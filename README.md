**What is Speech Emotion Detection?**
The computer analyzes and processes the signals that are given as an input ie. audio input, and it can get the emotional state of the other person. This behavior is called emotional recognition.Generally speaking, the language signals of tonal expressions in different languages also have different structural characteristics and distribution rules in terms of their time structure, amplitude structure, fundamental frequency structure and resonance peak structure. Therefore, as long as we measure and analyze the structural characteristics and distribution rules of language tone expressions of various specific patterns in terms of time structure, amplitude structure, fundamental frequency structure and resonance peak structure, the emotional content implied in all language tones can be identified.
